# 🢗 Wall-Climbing Rover using Suction – Inspired by F1 Fan Car (PoC)

## 🚀 Overview

This project documents a functional **wall-climbing rover** that adheres to vertical surfaces using aerodynamic suction force generated by EDF (Electric Ducted Fan) units. The concept was inspired by the legendary Brabham BT46B "Fan Car" from Formula 1, which used a fan to generate downforce. Similarly, this robot uses downward suction to create a pressure difference between the sealed bottom and the external atmosphere, resulting in substantial adhesion that allows it to climb walls.

The project is aimed at addressing practical applications like:

* Façade painting or cleaning
* Advertising banner installation
* Vertical inspection without scaffolding or aerial lifts

The rover is completely **remote-controlled** using a FlySky FS-i6X transmitter and receiver, and includes a water spray mechanism that mimics basic cleaning or painting functionality.

## 🖉 Motivation

Traditional climbing robots rely on magnets (which only work on ferrous surfaces), gecko-like adhesives (complex and difficult to maintain), or vacuum cups (bulky and power-hungry). I wanted to build a light, agile, and modular robot that could climb common walls like concrete or painted surfaces, without any permanent surface modification.

The idea came from F1's fan car concept — using active airflow to generate pressure differential, effectively "sucking" the vehicle onto a surface.

## 🔧 Hardware Breakdown

### Adhesion System

* 2x 64mm EDF fans (powered by 6S LiPo)
* Custom cut foam skirt surrounding the base of the robot
* Air chamber sealed to ensure downward airflow creates a vacuum effect

### Drive System

* 4x 12V Brushed DC geared motors (30 RPM)
* 2x L298N dual H-bridge drivers (for simplicity)
* Rubber wheels for wall traction

### Water Spray System

* 12V mini water pump
* Small reservoir
* Sprayer nozzle mounted at the front

### Power

* 6S LiPo (22.2V) for EDF fans
* 3S LiPo (11.1V) for motors, pump, and electronics

### Control

* FlySky FS-i6X + FS-iA6B receiver
* Channels mapped for fan throttle, motor control, and spray activation

## 🧠 Working Principle

The core working principle is based on **Bernoulli’s principle and pressure differential**. The EDF fans pull air out from the sealed chamber between the base of the robot and the wall. The foam skirt minimizes air leakage.

This leads to a pressure difference:

**P\_atmosphere > P\_inside\_chamber**

The resulting pressure drop creates **downward force** which presses the robot against the wall, generating friction at the wheels for movement.

We measured the generated suction using a **U-tube manometer** and calculated downforce as:

F = ΔP × A

Where:

* ΔP is pressure drop (measured via manometer height)
* A is the base area under suction

At \~50% throttle, we recorded **∼10 kgf of adhesion force**, which was more than sufficient to keep the robot pressed against a wall during operation.

## 📃 Control and Tuning

The robot is fully operated by a 6-channel RC transmitter. Key mappings:

* CH1 & CH2: Differential drive (left/right wheels)
* CH3: EDF throttle
* CH4: Spray activation (toggle or hold switch)

We chose **RC control over Arduino autonomous logic** initially to allow better tuning and reduce risk during wall tests.

Future versions can integrate:

* IMU-based stability control
* Wall-following using ToF sensors or vision
* Autonomous spraying via programmed paths

---

## 📊 Performance Observations

* The fan system alone created enough suction to suspend a 3+ kg robot securely
* Wall testing worked best on **painted drywall, glass, and smooth tiles**
* Skirt sealing was crucial; even small leaks dramatically reduced suction
* Battery drain from EDF fans is **significant** — approx. 3-5 mins at high throttle on 6S
* Spray system was effective and consistent, could be scaled up for more fluid

## 🌐 Future Enhancements

* Switch to **brushless motors** for better efficiency and weight
* Add **feedback control** for EDF throttling and wheel slip
* Integrate **ROS + SLAM** for autonomous climbing

## 🧮 Learnings

* Wall climbing with suction is highly viable with proper seal and airflow design
* Multi-battery design is important to isolate motor spikes
* Tuning EDFs and drive power simultaneously is tricky without closed-loop control
* Remote control helped with safe testing before full autonomy
